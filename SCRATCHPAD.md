# SCRATCHPAD

## Decisions
- App: Swipe-to-Trade MVP (mini)
- Stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Prisma + SQLite
- No auth/chat/payments for v1

## MVP Features
- Create listing: HAVE item + WANT text/tags
- Browse listings (feed)
- Search + filters (category, condition)
- Listing details page
- Create a "proposal" to trade (stored in DB)

## Notes
- Keep it simple: good structure > fancy UI.
- Save images as URLs for MVP (no uploads in v1).
